# Auto Planner
## Purpose
- I hoped to simplify the process of writing autonomous FRC code, so I produced a simple GUI rust program which allows the user to place points on an image of the game field, which will the be formatted into a C++ vector which can be copied into an autonomous command easily.
- Nothing has been done to allow for other commands to be done during the path driving, which is a potential limitation to the program, though through a combination of command compositions, it should be fairly simple.
